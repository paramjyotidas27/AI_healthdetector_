    <h2>1. What is Health?</h2>
    <p>
      Health is not merely the absence of disease, but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.
      It includes how you feel, how active you are, and how well you cope with stress and emotions.
      Maintaining good health requires a balanced approach — proper nutrition, fitness, hygiene, and emotional stability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Importance of Physical Fitness</h2>
    <p>
      Regular exercise keeps your heart strong, strengthens bones and muscles, and improves mental clarity.
      Activities like walking, cycling, yoga, and sports not only enhance stamina but also reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
      Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity daily.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Nutrition & Balanced Diet</h2>
    <p>
      A balanced diet provides the essential nutrients your body needs to function properly.
      Include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in the right proportions.
      Avoid excessive sugar, salt, and junk food — and stay hydrated throughout the day.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eat fresh fruits and vegetables daily.</li>
      <li>Include whole grains and lean proteins.</li>
      <li>Limit processed foods and sugary drinks.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Mental Health Awareness</h2>
    <p>
      Mental health is as important as physical health. It affects how we think, feel, and act.
      Stress, anxiety, and depression are common but manageable with the right support.
      Practicing mindfulness, staying socially connected, and talking openly about emotions can improve mental well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember — seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Hygiene & Preventive Care</h2>
    <p>
      Hygiene plays a vital role in preventing diseases. Simple habits like washing hands regularly,
      keeping surroundings clean, and eating hygienic food can prevent infections.
      Vaccinations, routine checkups, and safe lifestyle choices ensure long-term protection.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Healthy Lifestyle Tips</h2>
    <p>
      A few mindful steps can make a big difference in your health journey:

    <ul>
      <li>Get 7–8 hours of sleep every night.</li>
      <li>Stay hydrated — drink plenty of water.</li>
